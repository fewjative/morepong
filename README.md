morepong
========

Repo for my  'Pong' clone, however differentiates itself in that it has a power up system.

I am currently in the process of designing new mechanics, on top of the pre existing ones.

Known bugs: 
-initial sound playback causes game to sleep for too long(bug only occurs once during any play session.
-menu is hard too navigate due to the keyhandler

Fixed bugs:
-Game runs consistently for all users instead of performing based on the specs of the computer.
